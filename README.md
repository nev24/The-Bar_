This is a public Repository for a mobile app.
It is a game where you the player will have to answer questions for bartending much like this game much loke Candy Crush and merge put tgether but for now is in quiz format.


Edit :
(Title Not Decided) will be more of a game in the essence of a match and merge game where you work at a club or and have to make cocktails and mix beverages from raw ingredients which are held in your club storage, the factory processes raw ingredients and gets backed up if your not on top of your drink mixing.

Club goers come in to your club amd you make money from the orders you sell any wrong drinks or eventually food items will equal to a loss of money. Money will be equal to the amount you need to make to climb levels and buy new clubs.
you begin the game with one heart and once you lose that heart the level begins again. 

if your factory backs up you lose a man a man is equal to a club owner which is like you so will say that one man has however many heights to pass the level if he loses all of his hearts in the level which the whole thing only starts with one to begin with when you can buy more of them in the store. 
the first few levls the first few levels though will be easy to pass with one heart once the level start to get harder though it will be recommended or that the player buys more hearts.
things like unlimited hearts for a certain period of time will exist and also we be able to be bought in the store however buying containers hearts like in Zelda where you start out with three hearts and can get four will be made

You begin with 1 heart which equals at first a life 
If you lose a heart at the beginning of the game it will mean you lose your club and have to start over each club is the same as say a level once you have completed all the orders for the night or day the level or club you get another club.  
As the game progresses you can buy hearts from the store which will be you know very expensive because they're after like 10 levels you get one heart.
each level has a timer set which which is the equivalent of moves in Candy crush once the timer ends you lose a heart to pass a level you have to make enough money to move to the next club so if the timer ends and you don't have enough money you lose a heart and you have more hearts. the timer will restart with the amount of tips in your tip jar. so the amount in your tip jar raises with the amount of successful drinks however it is a randomized amount depending on the customer or the difficulty of the drink or whatever but some times it won't go up at all really and sometimes it will just go up a lot. 
whatever this is will decide when you lose a heart how much time is still on the timer for the level so that's what obviously be an algorithm.
drinks will have a certain amount of money that they return the stuff that it comes out of your storage should where will be the things that you put in your drinks however raw ingredients are not drinks so if your factory is backing up and gets backed up for too long the timer will stop and you will lose a man once you have lost all your men you have to wait for a certain amount of time where you can ask people online if you have an internet connection for help give you a man that sort of thing but you have to wait a certain do you get not only but you have to wait if they don't give you anything and also you have to start in the level before the proceeding level but you have to make the money again in that club and may the money to proceed to the next level.

when the customer is coming in they will say the drink that they want and it will come across the screen and stay there after a while another question will come up and have the item that they want. so the timer is running and you have to make said cocktail a screwdriver on and the size do you want to double they will say double in harder levels and they will ask for you know pints and high balls and things like that you need to know certain drinks so you have glasses and all those things as empty containers in the in your level you can see them on the on the gooey it's orange is being worked on as I speak and they will look like little cubes just like cute little little bubbly icons that are sitting in your storage you put them for the drink will come up with the amount of ingredients he blank spaces and stay there and you have to make them and they just start coming. example the drink a screwdriver high ball is being asked for and you have orange juice which comes from obviously oranges that come out of your factory which you need to crush then you have vodka which is made by combining to wheat that come out of your factory together and crush and mix with yeast which comes out of the factory as well they go in to another holding thing until a certain amount of time which will be there fermentation. like trying to yes they sit in this little like other box where they were sitting and waiting to  like trying to yes they sit in this little like other box where they wait like a cool down period. .5 second for beer 1 second for vodkas whiskey gin 2 second liquers up to scotches and tougher stuff.
the questions will be followed with empty spaces equal to that of the drink and then a number input on the bottom.
so a highball screwdriver is being asked for but another question for another highball screwdriver is being asked for however you can't make two drinks at the exact same time can you yes you can you're taking a bottle of it so it's one will have how many they can make so they will have five drinks so you can take make the first drink first you have to pour the first drink the second drink the second then the next one and the next one the next one you kind of back up until there's just little dots and you can't see them on the screen anymore but you know that you need and a half of 5 oz of orange juice and 1 oz of vodka and some ice which just keeps being made in your store or in your club it never runs out unless it's really busy there's always there but you know you got to put ice.
so for this drink you have your vodka at 1 oz then you have 5 oz of orange juice and one slot for ice. 
as the game goes on you can do stuff that makes the game more fun like garnish you buy garnishes in the store or are awarded them and they go in your storage. some like mint and parsley will actually come out of your factory once in awhile and are also free to buy from the store.
however they're free only once a day. like parsley mint and lemons. 
you can take lemons and limes. this will get added to. and is subject to change as I am not completely familiar with github. 

so I am copying everything from

Here is a link to the play store for that game
if you are unfamiliar with it.
